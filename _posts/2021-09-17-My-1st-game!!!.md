title: "My 1st Survival Game Devlog"
date: 2021-09-17

Hello, fellow humans! (Because I am DEFINITELY a human!)
Like I said in this blog's description, this is my first devlog AND survival game! I've done quite a bit of coding and Java, so I have a bit of knowledge, but
I know that I'm gonna need array lists, but have no idea how to add or replace items in an array list... So, I would like to enlist the help of you guys, the readers!
I'll PROBABLY post once or twice a week, so check back every so often!
Also, I know different people have different ways of how to code.
